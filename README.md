# oTree apps
This repository features some games that are executable with oTree. [oTree](http://www.otree.org) is an extension of the Django framework to build web applications tailored for experimental research purposes.

### Prerequisites
If you have Python 3 already installed, you only need to run `pip3 install -U otree` in a terminal.

In all other cases please work your way through the [installation guidelines for oTree](https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)

### Start an app
Clone or download this repository to your device. Open a terminal window (e.g. PowerShell on Windows), navigate inside the repository's directory and enter `otree devserver`. Open your browser and enter http://127.0.0.1:8000 in the address bar. You will have access to invitation links for participants in the same network.

Remark: While this works for a small number of concurrent participants in a local network, you might want to consider hosting the application on a server. Read the [corresponding chapter in the oTree documentation](https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/server/intro.html) for further details.
